# Material for learning Python

Code for teaching Python.

First Project ideas came from Invent with Python.

- [Guess Number](guess_new_number.py)
- [Hangman](hangman.py)
- [Wordle](wordle.py) (instead of Bagels)
- [tic tac toe](tic_tac_toe/)
    Reasonably over engineered version for the command line.

Some examples of Python code illustrated by tests at [examples](examples/README.md)
